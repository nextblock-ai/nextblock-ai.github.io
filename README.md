   ### Puck Admin Commands

        Puck supports a number of built-in commands for managing and interacting with the shell:

        - `help [topic]`: Display help information for a specific topic.
        - `$<command>`: Execute a shell command.
        - `puck <query1> ... <queryn>`: Recursively execute queries with Puck.
        - `+ <file>`: Run a file of commands.
        - `!`: Toggle hands-free (autonomous) mode.
        - `push`: Push message(s) to the conversation.
        - `pop`: Pop n messages from the conversation.
        - `ask`: Ask the user a question.
        - `done`: End the conversation.

        ### Aliases

        Puck allows you to create and manage command aliases for frequently used or complex commands. You can perform the following actions with aliases:

        - `alias-add <alias> <command>`: Add a new alias.
        - `alias-remove <alias>`: Remove an existing alias.
        - `alias-update <alias> <command>`: Update an existing alias.
        - `alias-list`: Display a list of all aliases.

        ### Modes

        Puck has two primary modes of operation:

          1. **Execution mode**: In this mode, Puck generates and executes shell commands based on user input. To toggle execution mode, enter `$` or run Puck with the `--exec` flag:

               ```
              puck --exec
              ```

          2. **View-only mode**: In this mode, Puck generates shell commands but does not execute them. This is useful for reviewing and verifying commands before running them. To toggle view-only mode, enter `.` or run Puck with the `--view` flag:

               ```
               puck --view
               ```

# 🔧Functionality

    ## What can you do with Puck?
  
          Puck simplifies the process by allowing users to express their intent in plain language and automating the underlying shell commands. Keep in mind that the generated commands might vary depending on the user's input, system configuration, and the OpenAI API's response.

       Tasks and capabilities that Puck offers:

       1. **File management**: Puck can handle various file-related operations like creating, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories.
       2. **System information**: Retrieve information about the system, such as hardware details, available resources, and running processes.
       3. **Text processing**: Puck can generate and manipulate text, including searching, filtering, and modifying files or output from other commands.
       4. **Network management**: Perform network diagnostics and tasks, such as checking connectivity, monitoring network traffic, and configuring network         settings.
       5. **Software management**: Manage software packages, including installation, removal, and updates.
       6. **User management**: Create, modify, and delete user accounts, as well as manage permissions and groups on the system.
       7. **Task automation**: Automate repetitive tasks by generating scripts or combining multiple commands into a single, more efficient command.
       8. **Code generation**: Generate example code snippets or templates based on user input for various programming languages.
       9. **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose and fix common issues with the system or provide guidance on how to resolve problems.
       10. **Custom command creation**: Create custom commands or aliases for frequently used or complex commands to streamline the user experience.

    It's worth mentioning that Puck's capabilities are limited only by the power of the OpenAI API and the user's imagination. Users can leverage Puck        to interact with their system through natural language, making complex shell operations more accessible and user-friendly.

   ## Examples
  
     Example One: Compare the contents of two directories, generate a report on the differences, and email it.
      
     Input: 

         ```
         Compare the contents of directory1 and directory2, generate a report highlighting the differences, and email the report to example@example.com.
         ```

     Puck Process: generate and execute a series of shell commands to perform the task as described:

          1.  Use the `diff` command to compare the contents of the two directories and output the differences to a file named `difference_report.txt`:

               ```
               diff -r directory1 directory2 > difference_report.txt
               ```

          2. Install a command-line email client like `mutt`, if it's not already installed:

               ```
               sudo apt-get install mutt
               ```

          3. Send the generated report `difference_report.txt` as an email attachment to the specified email address:

               ```
               mutt -s "Directory Comparison Report" example@example.com -a difference_report.txt < /dev/null
               ```
